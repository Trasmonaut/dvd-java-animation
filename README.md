# DVD Java Animation

A small Java program that simulates the classic bouncing DVD logo animation. Use this program to see a logo bounce around the window, change direction on collisions, and wait for the perfect corner hit.
Controls
- Press Space to pause / resume the animation.
- Press Esc to close the application window and exit the program.

Quick overview
- Language: Java (100%)
- Expected entry point: GameApplication.java (class with main)
- If your repository contains a file named `Game Application.java` (with a space), rename it to `GameApplication.java` to avoid problems when running from the console or packaging a JAR.

Prerequisites
- JDK 8 or newer installed and on your PATH.
- A Java-aware IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) can run the main class directly.
